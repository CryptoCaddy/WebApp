CryptoCaddy is a platform designed to automate the complicated process of generating gain/loss documents for tax purposes and live portfolio tracking based on exchange API keys, blockchain explorers and csv uploads. The web-app is the central component to the project and will be at the core of any peripheral mobile or desktop applications that become a part of the CryptoCaddy platform. 

This web-app repository is divided into 3 main components: web-services (Java/MySQL), fiat-engine (Python/MySQL) and web-ui (TypeScript/Angular). 


* The web-services directory is the root of the Java back end service for the web-app. It houses the central api that the web-ui and other peripherals will leverage to access private user and market level data. 
* The fiat-engine directory is the root of the Python service that will be used to access the historical fiat value of coins based on timestamps. It will keep the MySQL database up to date with historical market data and access that data as neccessary to convert historical coin values into fiat values when generating gain/loss data in the Java web-service.
* The web-ui is written with TypeScript and Angular. It uses the Java back end api for all data. It does not directly interface with the fiat-engine.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get CryptoCaddy up and running via docker on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Please view the READMEs within this project's subfolders for more specific development instructions or to run and develop each component individually without docker.

### Prerequisites

This project uses Docker Compose for its deployment, so you'll need

```
Docker 18.01+
Docker Compose 1.18+
A Firebase authentication credential (https://firebase.google.com/)
```

### Firebase

This project uses Google Firebase for authentication.  You can create an account for free or use an existing one if you have one.  Once an account is created generate an admin sdk service account and download the json credentials.  Rename the file to firebase-credentials.json and place it in the web-services folder.

### Installing

Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/CryptoCaddy/web-app.git
```

Export the following environment variables in terminal (arbitrary values are fine for testing)

```
MYSQL_DATABASE
MYSQL_USER
MYSQL_PASSWORD
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
```

Build with docker (run in the project's root directory).

```
docker-compose build
```

## Deployment

Run with Docker
```
docker-compose up -d
```

The server will take 3-5 minutes to fully start up, you can monitor its progress with this command
```
docker logs -f $(docker ps -f name=webapp_web -q)
```

When the following line appears the server has started. Feel free to use CTRL-C to exit the previous command, it will not kill the server.
```
2018-01-16 04:23:33.392  INFO 36 --- [           main] c.c.services.auditing.Application        : Started Application in 49.511 seconds (JVM running for 55.378)
```

CryptoCaddy will now be running on your local machine. You can access it in your browser at the ip given by the following command
```
docker-machine ip
```

## Loading changes

When applying changes use the following commands, please note that each component has specialized instructions for developing and testing changes so this should only be done when pulling from the repo or finalizing code changes as it is slow.

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

## Cleanup

Shutdown the website with the following command
```
docker-compose down
```

To completely cleanup the website and delete all data associated with it run
```
docker-compose down -v
```
